</h4>

A mod focused on *physically* extending the inventory (adding slots) through wearing various types of bags.  
Heavily inspired by makamys' [Satchels](https://github.com/makamys/Satchels) and by Cynosphere' [Scout](https://github.com/Cynosphere-mc/Scout)ã€‚

---
Items are retained on the bag items themselves. The bag items are equipped through [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) slots. A new slot type for satchels is added.
